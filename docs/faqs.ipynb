    "+ **What is QHub?**\n",
    "    + QHub is an [Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code#:~:text=Infrastructure%20as%20code%20(IaC)%20is,configuration%20or%20interactive%20configuration%20tools.) system that handles the management of infrastructure (networks, virtual machines, load balancers, and connection topology), using the same versioning as DevOps teams use for source code. Infrastructure as Code enables DevOps teams to test applications in production-like environments early in the development cycle. \n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "+ **What are some of the benefits of using QHub?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + QHub enables users to deliver stable environments rapidly and at scale. It allows teams enforce consistency by representing the desired state of their environments via code. Infrastructure as Code is prevent runtime issues caused by missing dependencies or configuration drifts. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Is QHub free?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + QHub is an open source project and free to use. However, the cloud service providers (AWS, GCP, Digital Ocean) accessed through QHub require your personal service account information. Any paid services these providers offer and you choose to use for your projects will not be free.   \n",

    "+ **What challenges does QHub fix?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + QHub abstracts away the complex details of deployment environments and management of infrastructure, making your configurations reproducible and your applications scaleable. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "+ **What technologies does QHub rely on?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + QHub integrates the cloud services, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Digital Ocean. \n",

    "+ **What is Jupyter Notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + The Jupyter Notebook is an open source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text on their browsers. See [Jupyter Notebook documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for details. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "+ **What is JupyterHub?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + JupyterHub is a multi-user hub that spawns, manages, and proxies multiple instances of the single-user Jupyter notebook server. See [JupyterHub documentation](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for details. \n",

    "+ **What is Dask?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Dask is an open source library for parallel computing written in Python. See [Dask documentation](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/) for details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Do I have to be an exprienced programmer/data scientist to use QHub?** \n",
    "\n",
    "    + Short answer is no. QHub is designed to make it easier for people to use cloud services, parallel computing, and many other open source tools by abstracting away some of the complexities they entail and providing users with the infrastructure that is ready to use and stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **What are environments? This term is used a few different ways terraform, conda, docker, dask.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    + A (programming) environment generally refers to a directory on your machine that contains a set of packages/dependencies that the program/application you want to run. One might think of a programming environment similar to a namespace as used in computer science, which refers to an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of names. For different infrastructures, the term environment might be defined slightly differently. For example, a [conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) is a collection of conda packages that one's program needs to work as desired. Terraform, which is an open source infrastructure as code software tool, defines an environment as \"refer to the idea of having multiple distinct, named states associated with a single configuration directory\" while a Dask environment is used interchangeably with [configuration](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/configuration.html). \n",
