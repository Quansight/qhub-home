# Sqribe: NDE of the future.

Sqribe is the working name for Qhub, and is the application that is served up to users.
It will be a way for people to contibute to curated open-source documentation surrounding the
python and pydata ecosystem, along with a portal to Sqribe's deployment tool.

## Tools

### Backend

I chose [Dino](https://deno.land/) as my tool to write this application. This was due in part to the fact that
it is interesting, cleaner than `npm`, and is far more community-driven open source as opposed to something like V8.
That being said, the [Deno 1.0](https://deno.land/v1) Release Candidate details the specific internals of the system.

### Frontend

I will choose [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) as the tool for my frontend. I will begin by using Vue and then move to Nuxt over time.
